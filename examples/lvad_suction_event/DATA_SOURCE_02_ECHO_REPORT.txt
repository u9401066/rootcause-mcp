TIME: 03:45
OPERATOR: DR. LEE (CARDIOLOGY FELLOW)
INDICATION: LVAD Low Flow, Hypotension.

FINDINGS:
IMAGE QUALITY: Poor (Body habitus).

LEFT VENTRICLE (LV):
- Cavity size appears SMALL and UNDERFILLED.
- Interventricular Septum (IVS) is shifted towards the LEFT (bowing into LV).
- Inflow Cannula position: Appears aligned, but difficult to visualize turbulence.

RIGHT VENTRICLE (RV):
- Severely DILATED.
- Hypokinetic free wall.
- TR (Tricuspid Regurgitation): Severe.
- IVC: Dilated (2.4 cm), non-collapsible.

PERICARDIUM:
- No significant effusion.

IMPRESSION:
1. Small, underfilled LV consistent with HYPOVOLEMIA.
2. RV Dilation/Failure.

RECOMMENDATION:
Continue volume resuscitation to fill the LV.
Consider increasing pump speed to maintain output?
