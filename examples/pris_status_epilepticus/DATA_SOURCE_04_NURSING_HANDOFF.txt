Overview: Bed 5 is crashing.
We think it's severe Sepsis + Pancreatitis from the alcohol.
Dr. Lee added Meropenem last night.
We started Levophed maxed out, adding Vasopressin.
His blood was weird when I drew the ABG - really thick and milky looking? Maybe just hemolyzed?
Also, his urine is a weird forest green color. Dr. says probably medication effect (Propofol or Methylene Blue? but he's not on Methylene Blue).
Family is asking why he is getting worse.
Watch out for the bradycardia, he dipped to HR 40 briefly before bouncing back.
