08:15 Surgeon: "Why is the muscle so tight? I haven't even cut yet. Is the patient light?"
08:16 Anesthesiologist: "BP is crashing. I'm giving Epi."
08:17 Surgeon: "The femoral pulse is gone! What did you do?"
08:18 Anesthesiologist: "I pushed 50 of Epi. It got worse. Is there massive bleeding inside? Did you puncture a vessel?"
08:19 Surgeon: "I haven't even started the incision! It's not bleeding!"

====================================================================
【COMMUNICATION BREAKDOWN ANALYSIS】

Key missed opportunities:
1. "Muscle so tight" - Endogenous catecholamine surge (stress response to shock)
2. "Is the patient light?" - Classic anchoring bias (light anesthesia as default)
3. "Epi got worse" - This is THE clue! Inotropes worsen dynamic obstruction
4. "Did you puncture a vessel?" - Blame-shifting instead of differential diagnosis

Neither provider considered:
- Why would vasopressors WORSEN the situation?
- What causes shock that gets WORSE with Epinephrine?
- What does the A-line waveform show?
