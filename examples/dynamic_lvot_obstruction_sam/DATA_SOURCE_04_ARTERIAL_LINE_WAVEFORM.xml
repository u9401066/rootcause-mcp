    Rapid upstroke.
    Mid-systolic notch.
    Second systolic peak lower than first.
    Stroke Volume Variation (SVV): 25% (High).

  ====================================================================
  【PATHOGNOMONIC WAVEFORM FOR HOCM/SAM】
  
  BISFERIENS PULSE:
  - Two systolic peaks separated by a mid-systolic dip
  - First peak: Initial ejection before SAM develops
  - Dip: SAM causes obstruction mid-systole
  - Second peak: Ejection after partial relief of obstruction
  
  SPIKE AND DOME:
  - Same phenomenon, different name
  - "Spike" = rapid initial upstroke
  - "Dome" = secondary rounded peak
  
  This waveform should have triggered immediate consideration of
  Dynamic LVOT Obstruction, NOT more vasopressors!
