TIME: 08:20 (Emergency TEE Probe Insertion)
OPERATOR: DR. CHEN (ANESTHESIOLOGIST)
INDICATION: Refractory Shock post-induction. R/O PE vs MI.

FINDINGS (MID-ESOPHAGEAL 4-CHAMBER & LONG AXIS):
1. **LV Cavity:** Hyperdynamic, small, obliterating at end-systole ("Kissing Walls").
2. **RV:** Normal size. No D-sign. (Rules out Massive PE).
3. **Mitral Valve:**
   - Moderate Mitral Regurgitation (MR).
   - **Eccentric Jet:** Directed posteriorly towards the LA wall.
   - **Leaflet Motion:** Anterior leaflet appears to move towards the Septum during systole.
4. **Aortic Valve:** Normal opening.
5. **LVOT (Left Ventricular Outflow Tract):**
   - Color Doppler shows severe turbulence/aliasing at the LVOT level.
   - Continuous Wave (CW) Doppler: **"Dagger-shaped" (Late-peaking) profile**.
   - Peak Gradient estimated > 80 mmHg.

IMPRESSION:
Unknown mechanism of shock. Severe LVOT gradient observed.

====================================================================
【KEY FINDINGS MISSED BY OPERATOR】

The operator wrote "Unknown mechanism" but the findings ARE the diagnosis:
1. SAM (Systolic Anterior Motion) = Anterior leaflet moving towards Septum
2. Dynamic LVOT Obstruction = Dagger-shaped Doppler (NOT fixed AS)
3. Secondary MR = Eccentric posterior jet (due to SAM pulling leaflet)

This is HOCM-like physiology triggered by:
- Low preload (Propofol + positioning)
- Low afterload (Propofol)
- Hyperdynamic LV (probably underlying septal hypertrophy)
